Initial Commit 2

Situation Description
The Python Dice Roll Game is a straightforward console game that lets players roll a fictitious six-sided die. 
Users of the game have a pleasant and engaging way to simulate the excitement of rolling dice without using actual dice.

Approach to Solving Issues
This project's primary objective is to develop a Python programme that replicates the rolling of a dice and generates a random number between 1 and 6, just like a real six-sided die. Until the player decides to end the game, they can roll the dice as often as they choose.

The following phases can be used to breakdown the problem-solving method:

Displaying Welcome Message: A welcome message outlining the game's regulations will be displayed to the user by the programme.

User Input: The programme will prompt the user to indicate whether they are ready to throw the dice or end the game. The user's response can be typed in.

Dice Roll: The programme will produce a random number between 1 and 6 and display it as the outcome of the dice roll when the user choose to roll the dice.

User Decision: The programme will ask the user if they want to roll the dice again or end the game after presenting the outcome of the dice roll.

Loop: Until the player chooses to end the game, it will keep looping.

Game Exit: If the player decides to end the game, the programme will say farewell and exit.
